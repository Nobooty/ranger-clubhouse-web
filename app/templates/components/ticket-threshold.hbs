  To qualify for a ticket to the {{ticketYear}} event you need {{credits-format rpThreshold}} credits
  for a reduced-price ticket and {{credits-format scThreshold}} credits for a staff credential.

      <strong>Congratulations!</strong> You're signed up for {{credits-format credits}} credits
      worth of shifts, which is above the {{credits-format scThreshold}} credits required
      to qualify for a {{ticketYear}} free staff credential.
      {{#if withinSCThreshold}}
        But since you are close to the threshold, you may want to sign up for
        one more shift. (See fine print below.)

      <br><strong>Congratulations!</strong> You're signed up for {{credits-format credits}} credits worth of shifts,
      which is above the {{credits-format rpThreshold}} credits required to qualify for a reduced-price ticket in {{ticketYear}}.
      You need only {{credits-format scDelta}} credits more to qualify for a staff credential.
      {{#if withinRPThreshold}}
        Since you are close to the threshold, you may want to sign up for one more shift.

      <strong>The fine print:</strong> The total credits listed above are based on scheduled
      shift times, but ticket qualification credits are based on the hours you
      actually work. In other words, if a shift runs longer than the scheduled time,
      you'll receive more credits -- but more importantly, if a shift runs shorter
      than the scheduled time (which is typical for Burn Perimeter and Art Safety
      shifts), you'll receive fewer credits. If by the end of the event your total
      credits based on actual shift times are less than the required threhhold, then
      you won't qualify for a (reduced-price or staff credential) ticket in
      {{ticketYear}}. If you're just over a threshold and are depending on Burn
      Perimeter or Art Safety shifts to get you there, you might consider adding
      another shift or two to be on the safe side.
