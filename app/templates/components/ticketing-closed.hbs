  <p>
    Alphas and Prospective Rangers who have signed up for or completed
    training and intend to walk an Alpha shift on playa are eligible for a
    Work Access Pass (WAP) that allows them to enter the event on or any day after
    {{mdy-format ticketingInfo.wap_alpha_default_date full=true}}
    at 00:01 (one minute after midnight).
  </p>
  <p><b>The WAP is good for the Alpha/Prospective only</b>, and does not extend to significant others or
    traveling companions.Â

      July 21st and August 8th.</b>
