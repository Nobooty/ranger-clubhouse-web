<h1>All Access Documents</h1>
<p>Below is everybody who has a qualified, claimed, or banked
  Access Document in the system. Claimed items are shown in green,
  banked in yellowish-orange. "SOs" is a count of how many significant-other
  Work Access Passes that person has. "Weird Stuff" should be anything that looks
  odd about this person's collection of Access Documents.</p>
