<h1>Contact An Active Ranger</h1>

<p>
  Use this page to send a contact message, via email, to a Ranger. Messages may only be
  sent to currently active or inactive Rangers. (An inactive Ranger is a person
  who has not rangered the last three years.) Individuals who are prospectives,
  alphas, bonked, retired, etc. may not be sent a message through this service.
</p>
<p>
  Neither your email address nor the email address of the receiving Ranger will
  be revealed by the Clubhouse.
</p>
<p>
  Start typing the callsign of the Ranger you wish to communicate with. Callsign
  containing numbers or spelled out numbers must be entered as-is. (e.g., callsign 'Disco9' needs
  to be entered as 'Disco9', not 'Disco nine'. Callsign 'Eight Dogs' needs to
  entered as 'Eight Dogs', not '8 dogs'.)
</p>
<p>
  <b>A Ranger callsign may not appear in the search results if the person is no longer active.</b>
