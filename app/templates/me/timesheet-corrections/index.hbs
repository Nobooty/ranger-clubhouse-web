  To ensure you will receive proper credit for your {{timesheetInfo.correction_year}}
  Ranger efforts, please follow all steps on this page. You need to confirm your
  whole timesheet at the end.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>1. Review your timesheet entries and mark each as correct or incorrect.</strong>
  If the entry is incorrect, provide an explanation on why the entry is wrong.

</p>
<p>
  <strong>2. Is your timesheet missing a shift?</strong>
  For any missing shifts, fill out the Missing Timesheet Entry Request form.
  You may submit more than one request.<br>
  <LinkTo @route="me.timesheet-corrections.missing" class="btn btn-primary">Submit A Missing Entry Request</LinkTo>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>3. Final step - Let us know you believe the timesheet is correct, and you
    have no more corrections to submit.
  </strong>
  After your very last shift for the event, AND all your timesheets
  have been marked as correct, AND there are no outstanding correction requests,
  let us know.<br>
